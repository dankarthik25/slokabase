Om! May God protect us both together; 
May God nourish us both together; 
May we work together(conjointly) with great energy, 
May our intelect be Sharpened/Enlightenment  to higher degree; 
May we not have  animosity/mutually dispute (due to false ego,selfishness).
Om! Let there be Peace in me! 
Let there be Peace on to you! 
Let there be peace to all!
