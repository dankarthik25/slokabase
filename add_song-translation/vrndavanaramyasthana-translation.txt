1) Beautiful Vrndavana is filled with cintamani gems and many jewel palaces and temples. Many regal swans play in the waters of the Yamuna, and in those waters a splendid golden lotus flower grows.

2) In the middle of that lotus is a golden place surrounded by eight petals. On these eight petals the eight principal gopis reside, and in the center Lord Syamasundara and beautiful Srimati Radharani sit on a jewel throne.

3) The great beauty of the Divine couple and Their charming joking and laughter continually showers nectar everywhere. Narottama dasa says: “I pray that these blissful eternal transcendental pastimes of the Divine Couple may be always manifested in my heart.”
