1) O Beholder of the flute (Vamsi Dhari)! O Krsna Murari! Without You, all is misery, O remover of my distress! Please be merciful to me, O Lord, and protect my modesty.

Kindly cause me to remember Your feet that bestow fearlessness, and allow me to chant Your holy name. You are my master! I worship You, O Giridhari!
