Refrain: Of all forms of worship of the Lord, love is the highest.

Lord Krsna renounced the delicacies that Duryodhana offered, and ate vegetables at Vidura’s house.

As Lord Ramacandra, He ate fruits which were already filled with love from Sabari.

Love is indeed the best way to serve and please the Lord.

In Maharaja Yuddhistira’s Rajasuya Yajna sacrifice, Lord Krsna served the brahmanas and picked up their eating utensils.

Out of pure love for Arjuna, He took the position of being his charioteer, and He forgot that He was the Lord.

Such love did Lord Krsna portray in Vrndavana when He danced with the gopis in the rasa lila.

The harsh Suradasa is not worthy to praise the merciful and magnanimous Lord.
