Please arise, please arise in the temple of my heart, O Madhava! O Krsna! O Gopal! Please arise, glowing radiantly in my heart like the new sunrise, O beautiful one! O Darling Giridhari-Lal!

Tears are pouring from my eyes like a monsoon cloudburst! Please arise, please arise, O youthful Kisora! O dark Syamal! O most beloved of Srimati Radharani! Please arise in my heart! Please arise, O maintainer of the cowheards!

O darling of Yasoda! Come, please come, O butter thief! O Lord of my life! Please come, O youthful boy! Bringing Radha along at Your left, in the abode of Vraja within my heart, please come O protector of Vraja!
