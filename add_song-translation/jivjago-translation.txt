Lord Gauranga is calling, "Wake up, sleeping souls! Wake up, sleeping souls! How long will you sleep in the lap of the witch called Maya?

You have forgotten the way of devotional service and are lost in the world of birth and death.

I have descended just to save you; other than Myself you have no friend in this world.

I have brought the medicine that will wipe out the disease of illusion from which you are suffering. Take this maha-mantra-Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/Hare Rama, Hare Rama Rama Rama, Hare Hare."

Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura says: "I fall at the Lord's feet, having taken this mahƒÅ-mantra."
