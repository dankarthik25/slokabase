Refrain: O beautiful one! O youthful boy who lives in my heart! Please come to me, O dark Syamal, O delighter of my eyes!

The desire of my heart is to worship You intimately. In this hope, I humbly bow unto Your lotus feet.

O love of my eyes! Please take me with You! While I am suffering in Your separation, the melody of our impending meeting is the only thing that gives me any happiness. O monarch of my life! Why do You remain silent and never speak to me? Tears are flowing from my eyes, and nothing in this world gives me any satisfaction.

How much longer must I continue living in this condition? You are making me weep and cry out for You, O darling Giridhari Lal! If I cannot attain You in this lifetime, then I shall just give up and surrender myself unto death.
