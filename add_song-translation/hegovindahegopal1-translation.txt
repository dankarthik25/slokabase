Refrain: Oh Govinda, the Lord of the Cows! Oh Gopala! Oh Merciful Lord! Oh Young Darling Boy! Oh Krsna!

You are the Lord of our orphaned souls. You are the redeemer of the fallen souls.

Oh Lord of infinite power and glories! You are the redeemer of the soul covered in illusion and attachment.

In the very dangerous abyss of darkness, please redeem Nanak by crossing this pit.
