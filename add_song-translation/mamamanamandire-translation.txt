Please abide in the temple of my heart both day and night, O Krsna Murari, O Sri Krsna Murari!

Devotion, love, flower garlands, and sandalwood- please accept them, ODelighter of the Heart!

3) In life or in death I worship You with these offerings,Beautiful One, O Enchanter of the Heart!

Come, son of Nanda, and then, O Son of Nanda, I will offer Your arati ceremony with the lamplight of my love.

5) The waters of the Yamuna River cascade incessantly from my eyes in your separation, O Holder of Govardhana Hill!

6) May I pass my life absorbed only in songs of Your praise, O Krsna Murari, Sri Krsna Murari!
