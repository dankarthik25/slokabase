After how long will I see You, O darling Giridhari Lal? Until then, I will simply remain here, waiting and waiting! Tears are flowing incessantly from my eyes. O when will You give me Your glance?

2) O dear Lord, I have surrendered my mind and body, as flowers for worship, to Your lotus feet. I have a plea. My heart is fervent based on such hope. Will they go unfulfilled?

3) As I wait behind for You, Oh please play Your flute, as Your flute contain all the sweet mellow melodic notes.

4) O Merciless One, if You donâ€™t provide me Your glimpse, why did You fill my heart with such hope? O life and soul of Mira! My desire is only for You! When will my desire be fulfilled?
