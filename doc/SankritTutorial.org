** IAST
International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration (IAST) is a transliteration scheme that allows the lossless romanisation of Indic scripts as employed by Sanskrit and related Indic languages. It is based on a scheme that emerged during the 19th century from suggestions by Charles Trevelyan, William Jones, Monier Monier-Williams and other scholars, and formalised by the Transliteration Committee of the Geneva Oriental Congress, in September 1894.

** [dhātu,shabda, avyaya] Three basic parts of speech  
soruce : https://sanskritdocuments.org/learning_tools/grammarintro_sa.html \\
There are three basic parts of speech in sanskrit :
- shabda (nouns/ pronouns/ adjectives/ participles),
- dhātu(verbs), (indicated with a root symbol $\sqrt{\;\;}$)
- avyaya (indeclinables: prepositions,conjunctions,adverbs, exclamations etc.)

Here we shall discuss declentions of nouns .
The form of a noun used in a sentence dependes on two things :
- Its number, (singular,dual or plural) and
- its vibhakti .

The vibhakti to be used is governed by the role the noun plays in the sentence, \\
- e.g . subject,object, instrument of action etc .
Here is a brief explanation of vibhaktis along with an example :

** Vibhaktis :
source : https://sanskritdocuments.org/learning_tools/grammarintro_sa.html \\
There are eight possible vibhaktis of a word . \\
Of these, six relate to an action and hence are also  "kāraks" \\
The other two ṣaṣṭhī(Possesive) and sambodhan(Denominative) do not necessarily associate with an action. \\
The following table lists the vibhaktis and their meanings. \\

| prathamā  | प्रथमा  | Nominative   | performer/subject                            |
| dvitīyā   | द्वितीया | Accusative   | object                                        |
| tr̥tīyā    | तृतीया  | Instrumental | instrument                                   |
| caturthī  | चतुर्थी  | Dative       | for whom the action is performed              |
| paṁcamī   | पंचमी  | Ablative     | from where the action is performed            |
| ṣaṣṭhī    | षष्ठी   | Possesive    | not strictly a vibhakti, denotes possesi on   |
| saptamī   | सप्तमी  | Locative     | location of the action                        |
| sambodhan | सम्बोधन् | Denominative | used to address someone                       |

X = $\frac{Words \;representing \;properties}{Words \;representing \;objects}$ = *Words representing properties : Words representing objects*
-  For most languages:
  - X < 1
  - X $\approx$  1 (approx.)
  - X  > 1 (slightly)
- For Sanskrit:
  - X $\approx$ 10^5 (Lakhs)

dhātu [धातु] : root word \\
A dhātu is a rudimentary verbal element form which words are derived: it is nuclcus to which other word fragments are added to form a whole word.


#+begin_quote
In Sanskrit there are 2012 dhAtus. 
every word in sankrit end with vowel(svara स्वरा)

** Verbs


A dhātu (indicated with a root symbol $\sqrt{\;\;}$) develops to form a stem (anga) and to the stem is added a pernonal ending (tin-vibhakti) to complete verb (kriya).

A dātu indicated with a surd or root symbol  $\sqrt{\;\;}$ before i) develops to form a stem a  (anga ) and to the stem is added a p ersonal ending (tiṅ-vibhakti ) to form a complete verb kriyā ).



| prathama-puruṣa | tiṣṭhati | he /she /it stands |
| madhyama-puruṣa | tiṣṭhasi | you stand          |
| uttama-puruṣa   | tiṣṭhāmi | I stand            |
